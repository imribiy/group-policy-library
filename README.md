# Group policy library

Group policy dwords for Windows 10 & 11 that I find useful.

Note: Please don't apply whole repository without reading, it can break some functions of Windows.

# What will it change? What will be the benefits?

Main goal of this repository is hardening Windows telemetry and improving quality of life. You can expect some performance outcome as well (probably at minor level) 
Please read file names carefully, some settings might not be useful for you.

Note: When you check gpedit you will see the options as "Not configured", that's because we change policies through regedit. Don't get confused. They will be applied.
